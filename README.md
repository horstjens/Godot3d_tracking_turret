# Godot3d_tracking_turret
trying to learn godot 3d: problem of turret that (slowly) rotates toward a moving target

move target around with keys: w,a,s,d,q,e

cannon (sphere with yellow cylinders) looks has code to look towards target

problem: only rotated spheres (blue cylinders) look correctly toward target
